## Scooter app

### Some explanation:

My aim was  to use Typescript with the latest version of RN. However, when installing RN Firebase, I faced alot of problems with pods configurations. I ended up using an older version of RN 0.67 and Firebase worked (after some effort). 
I also had linting, husky, prettier, eslint and everything configured in the typescript version. But with this version, linting is a bit more simpler.

I have resued some components in login and signup but on the map screen the situation was a bit more chaotic. At least, I was able to demonstrate my ability.

I think that the api for sending orders had a problem (Could be from my side too?), I was getting 401. So I commented it out and assumed it was working.

I tried my best to understand the task and come up with assumptions. I hope I was able to build what was required in the task.

I think I have missed some points but I solved most of what was asked.

Looking forward to your feedback.
