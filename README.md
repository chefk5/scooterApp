## Scooter app

A task for one of the positions I applied for. The user shpuld be able to pair with a scooter and then find it on the map. After the that, the user can see some information about the scooter (batter, name etc). The user can also create an account and login.

- Libraries used: 
  - google maps
  - firebase
  - react navigation
  
#### Improvements 

- Move folders inside a src folders
- add infomration about the scooter into one hook
